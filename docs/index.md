# IBM HElayers

## Scope

IBM HElayers is a software development kit (SDK) for the practical and efficient
execution of encrypted workloads using fully homomorphic encrypted data.
HElayers is designed to enable application developers and data scientists to
seamlessly apply advanced privacy-preserving techniques without requiring
specialized skills in cryptography.

## Usage
