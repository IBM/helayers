    "The IBM Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) Service is an early beta programme provided under the [Community Edition License](https://ibm.ent.box.com/s/zfl6rt2p09811nyy8yow8t3mpsmkmsw6) intended to help customers understand and develop use cases utilizing the power of FHE. This service enables data scientists and developers to deploy privacy preserving machine learning driven Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) applications in the Cloud.\n",
    "\n",
    "The IBM Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) Service is powered by [HELayers](https://hub.docker.com/r/ibmcom/helayers-pylab) , IBM's FHE AI SDK.\n",
    "\n",
    "The underlying assumed Trust Model of the deployed application is such that the browser or the client initiating the requests to the deployed application is running in a trusted environment while the deployed application in the Cloud is running in an untrusted environment\n",
    "\n",
    "Since FHE allows for arbitrary computation over encrypted data, this Service enables clients to encrypt data in a trusted environment, send it for processing in an untrusted environment, receive the encrypted results of the processing and then decrypt in the trusted environment. This ensures that data, while not in the trusted environment is always encrypted, in transit, at rest and during compute.\n",

    "\n",
    "The ML Model owner must be a registered user of FHE Cloud Service. As an ML Model owner you can deploy a model, the deployment produces a \"ML Model base url\". This url endpoint exposes RESTful API that can be used to perform training and inference (prediction) on the ML Model, to manage the ML Model and manage its' FHE keys and retrieve usage information. The \"ML Model base url\" should be published to ML Model users so they can register to the ML Model and use it (see ML Model User Flow). You can also retrive the \"ML Model base url\" using a rest call to the FHE Cloud Service API based on ML Model details you specified on deployment."

The user can save the secret context on his side or encrypt it and use the FHE Cloud Service API to upload and retrieve it.
