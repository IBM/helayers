# HElayers

## Scope

IBM HElayers is software development kit (SDK) for the practical and efficient
execution of encrypted workloads using fully homomorphic encrypted data.
HElayers is designed to enable application developers and data scientists to
seamlessly apply advanced privacy preserving techniques without requiring
specialized skills in cryptography.

## Usage

### Python API with helayers-pylab Docker image

Use the [`ibmcom/helayers-pylab`](https://hub.docker.com/r/ibmcom/helayers-pylab)
Docker image to explore and use HElayers using a Python API.

Use the [`ibmcom/helayers-pylab-s390x`](https://hub.docker.com/r/ibmcom/helayers-pylab-s390x)
Docker image to explore and use HElayers using a Python API on IBM Z and IBM
LinuxONE.

### C++ API with helayers-lab Docker image

Use the [`ibmcom/helayers-lab`](https://hub.docker.com/r/ibmcom/helayers-lab)
Docker image to explore and use HElayers using C++ API.
